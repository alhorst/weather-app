A very simple weather app created for the purpose of understanding how to consume APIs with JavaScript! Very much a WIP! Eventually this web app will be catered to weird people like myself who love :umbrella: rainy, cloudy days :cloud: and it will give custom descriptions/messages if it's raining outside (and maybe eventually will show future weather). For now, still working on parsing the correct JSON data from the API.
