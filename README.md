# A Weather App for Art Lovers :art:
A very simple weather app created for the purpose of understanding how to consume APIs with vanilla JavaScript! Very much a WIP! Eventually this web app will be catered to art/art history lovers like myself and depending on the JSON returned from the API, will change the background to a seasonally and weather relevant painting.
